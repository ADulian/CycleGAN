## Introduction
This project was made specifically for the Kaggle Competition [*"I'm something of a Painter Myself"*](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started), you can download the Monet dataset from Kaggle to get started.

**CycleGAN** is a powerful technique for unsupervised image-to-image translation, 
which learns to map images from one domain to another without requiring paired examples. 
This repository implements the CycleGAN model as proposed in 2017 in the paper 
[*"Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks"*](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Zhu_Unpaired_Image-To-Image_Translation_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)
